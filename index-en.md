# Hello, World

This is my page, [here](./about-en.html) i'll tell you about myself, show you some thing i've done and try and convice you to call me to your next project.

## 1. Article
#### Optimizing Simulated Annealing hyper-parameters for function roots search using genetic algorithms
By the end of my first year of college I had the chance to take part in a scientific initiation with Iara da Cunha. Our objective was to efficiently find zeroes of functions, to accomplish such task i learned about optimization heuristics, e noticed that there was the possibility of optimizing the optimization heuristic, I used a genetic algorithm for that. Article available at [Revista Eletrônica de Iniciação Científica em Computação](goo.gl/dJZVQt), from UFRGS.

## 2. Aricle
#### Extension and control of IP cameras via reserve engineering, and it's application in image recognition
In this project the objective was solving the problem of controlling several IP cameras (of questionable precedence) for utilizing computer vision tests. Solving the problem was achieved by dividing it into two parts: Camera control and Image recognition.
For the first part I reverse-engineered the UI's requests to the camera, created a C application thar recieves a command for the camera, read a JSON configuration file for that camera type, interpreted how to make the correct request for the camera and used libcurl to send the request.
Solved the pragmatic camera control problem i used OpenCV to open the camera feed, apply thresholding of the frames to get a centroid, the difference from the image center to the centroid was used to center the cameras. Available at [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/Cauef/ctrlcam/).

## 3. Project
#### Fat-array
Dinamic vectors of arbitrary type using C to guarantee strong typing and utilization flexibility. Available [here](https://github.com/cauefcr/Fat-Array)

## 4. Game
I created a game with Construct 2, in this game you're the monster, trying to protect your tower from the pesky, greedy adventurers, play [here](https://caue.site/whosinmytower)
